# PRI Frequency Image Dataset

The PRI frequency features of the radar pulse sequence could be represented by an image and we achieve pixel classification by a semantic segmentation network. The paper has been prepared to submit.
We're sharing them here for developers and researchers to explore, study, and learn from.

#### Novelty  
![preview](preview.jpg)
Given received signal strength (RSS) measurements of the commodity WiFi receiver at the UAV, UH-Sense can **detect** and **localize** moving human targets in the monitored area.
- A combination of neural network-based classifier and radio tomography imaging technique (RTI) is utilized to determine the presence of targets and their relative positions, respectively.
